# Project_Learn_Rust

This repo is dedicated to me learning rust and documenting it while I do it. I'm breaking down this "project" into two parts:
 - embedded
 - desktop

Most of the work I do on this repo will be embedded, but rust is a weird language, nahmean? So I'm going to do some general rust programming examples and stick it in a desktop folder for reference. If you've happened upon this repo and plan on using it to learn or maybe as reference, I must warn you that I am not a great programmer. I like firmware and hardware. Anything higher than that is extra, so you might see some of my code and think it sucks.
